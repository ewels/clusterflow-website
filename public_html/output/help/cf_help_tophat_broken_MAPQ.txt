 Tophat Module
---------------

TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads.
It aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra
high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie2, and then analyzes the
mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons.

This module detects the encoding of input fastq files and whether
they're paired end or not. It can run with or without a supplied
GTF path but requires a bowtie2 path.

Note that this module uses the -g 1 parameter to only return unique
hits. However, a bug in tophat means that all MAPQ values are
incorrectly returned as 50. This has been reported to the tophat
authors, in the mean time, you can use the new tophat.cfmod module
to fix this behaviour.
