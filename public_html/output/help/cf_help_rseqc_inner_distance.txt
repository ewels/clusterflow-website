 RSeQC - Inner Distance
------------------------------

Module to run RSeQC 'inner distance' script:
http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/#inner-distance-py
Calculates the distance between reasd for an RNA-seq library, whilst
considering introns. Takes aligned BAM files as input. Requires a
BED12 reference gene model. Uses first 1000000 reads.

Use the 'keep_intermediate' parameter to keep the inner_distance.txt
and inner_distance_plot.r files, otherwise these will be deleted.
