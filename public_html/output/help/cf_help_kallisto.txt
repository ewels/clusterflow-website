 Kallisto
-----------------

kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq 
data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput sequencing 
reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly 
determining the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for 
alignment. Pseudoalignment of reads preserves the key information needed for 
quantification, and kallisto is therefore not only fast, but also as accurate 
as existing quantification tools. In fact, because the pseudoalignment 
procedure is robust to errors in the reads, in many benchmarks kallisto 
significantly outperforms existing tools.
