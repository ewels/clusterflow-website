 Hisat2 Module
---------------

Hisat2 is a spliced aligner for RNA-Seq data.  It is fast and memory
efficient.
This script works out the encoding of input files, guesses whether they're
paired end or not and runs hisat2. Output is piped through samtools to
generate BAM files.

For further information, please run hisat2 --help
