 Tophat Module
---------------

TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads.
It can run with or without a supplied GTF path but requires
a bowtie2 path.

This module fixes a bug in tophat that relates to MAPQ values;
by using –g 1 (as in the previous tophat module), ALL alignments will
get a MAPQ score of 50, irrespective of whether they were unique
alignments or not. This module uses –g 2 instead, so reporting up
to 2 alignments for a given read. One of the alignments is considered
the primary alignment, and the other one is flagged as secondary
alignment, and both alignments now get a MAPQ value of 3 to indicate
that there were multiple alignments. After Tophat has finished, this
module uses samtools to filter out the secondary alignments.

In short, this module produces a BAM file with an equivalent number
of hits as the old module, but with fixed MAPQ values.
