---------------

Takes two input files: a bam file and an (optional) _crosscorrelation.txt file,
as created by phantompeaktools. Creates a "fingerprint" plot of
the read coverage, using deepTools/plotFingerprint. Outputs are are
plot files named basename_fingerprint.png. The fragment length is set
using 1) the input parameter fragmentLength 2) the file _crosscorrelation.txt
and 3) default fragment length of 200 (if no input parameter is set
and the file _crosscorrelation.txt doesn't exist).
