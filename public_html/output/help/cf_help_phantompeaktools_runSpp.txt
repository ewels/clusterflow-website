Phantompeaktools run SPP---------------

Takes (deduplicated) bam files as input and runs cross correlation analysis,
using the run_spp.r script from the pantompeaktools packeage. Outputs for
each bam file are basename_crosscorrelation.pdf (a cross correlation plot)
and  basename_crosscorrelation.txt (a text file with various cross correlation
statistics). For convenience the input bam file is also passed on as output
to be used by the next script in the pipeline.
