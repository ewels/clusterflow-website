 Samtools Sort & Index Module
------------------------------

Tries to index BAM / SAM files. If fails, assumes that file is not sorted
and runs samtools sort, then attempts to index again.
Will assume anything not ending in .bam is a SAM file and will convert to
BAM. Output is basename_srtd.bam if sorted.
Index files are written to disk but not written to CF run files.
Using parameter 'byname' or '-n' in pipeline forces sorting by read name.
