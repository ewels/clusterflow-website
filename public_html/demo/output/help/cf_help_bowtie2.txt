 Bowtie 2 Module
-----------------

Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing
reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads
of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good at
aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes.
This script works out the encoding of input files, guesses whether they're
paired end or not and runs bowtie 2. Output is piped through samtools to
generate BAM files.

For further information, please run bowtie2 --help
