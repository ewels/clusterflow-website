 Bismark Coverage Analysis Module
--------------------------------------

The bismark_coverage module runs the bismark coverage2cytosine script.
This reads in a bismark reference and creates a .cov file with coverage information
about every cytosine in the genome. The module then uses this to plot two
informative plots about the coverage of the experiment.
Use the capture_regions=<filename.txt> paramter when doing a sequence capture
experiment for information about targeted enrichment.
Use coverage2cytosine --help for more information.
