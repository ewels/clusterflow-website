# Cluster Flow is now archived

_This project is no longer under active maintenance. You're welcome to use it, but no updates or bug fixes will be posted. We recommend using [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) together with [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) instead._

_A static copy of <http://clusterflow.io> (made Apr 8, 2023) is now running at <https://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/> for archival purposes._

_Many thanks to everyone who used and supported Cluster Flow over the years._
