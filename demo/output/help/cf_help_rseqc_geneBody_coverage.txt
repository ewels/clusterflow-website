 RSeQC - Inner Distance

Module to run RSeQC 'Gene Body Coverage' script:
http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/#genebody-coverage-py
Calculates the average coverage across genes > 100bp long and plots
a histogram. Takes aligned BAM files as input. Requires a
BED12 reference gene model.

Can be run as a normal module (#rseqc_geneBody_coverage), which will
make one histogram per file. Or run as a summary module
(>rseqc_geneBody_coverage) which will plot a single histogram for
all BAM files found in the run files.
