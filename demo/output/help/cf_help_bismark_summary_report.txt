 Bismark Pipeline Summary Module
----------------------

The summary_bismark_pipeline module takes all run files from a Cluster
Flow pipeline and looks for log files generated by bismark processing.
It reads these, looking for certain values, and generates a .csv and .html
summary report of the numbers for all samples processed in the pipeline.
