CF Merge Files Module
-----------------------
This core Cluster Flow module merges files. It can be used in two ways:

1. Setting --merge on the command line or @merge_regex in the configuration
file. The core cf executable will use this string in a regex for each
input file and try to group them. The module will automatically be
prepended to your pipeline. This is useful for sequencing centres who
split samples across lanes, for example.

2. Using the module in the middle of a pipeline, with a parameter set as
the merge regex. For example: #cf_merge_files regex="[a-z]_(P\d+)_[12]"
This is useful when a pipeline generates multiple files from a step
and you would like to merge them. Note that input file lists will be
split into parallel runs by Cluster Flow, and the module will not be
able to merge files in parallel threads.

The module uses the regex to match filenames. A single set of parentheses
should be used for the unique grouping factor. This will be used for the
resulting output filename.

For example, consider the following regex:
[1-6]_[0-9]{6}_[a-zA-Z0-9]+_(P\d+_\d+_[12]).fastq.gz

If used with the following files:
1_120119_QOS3SBTASX_P8294_101_1.fastq.gz
2_120119_QOS3SBTASX_P8294_101_1.fastq.gz

Would result in the following merged file: P8294_101_1.fastq.gz

As such, this module can also be used to clean up file names without
actually merging anything.
