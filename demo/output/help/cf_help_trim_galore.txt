 Trim Galore Module
--------------------

Trim Galore is a wrapper tool around Cutadapt and FastQC
to consistently apply quality and adapter trimming to FastQ files.

This module intelligently works on single end and paired end input files
and tries to calculate input file fastq encoding.

By default, it will not trim files with reads shorter than 50bp
(it checks the first file). This behaviour can be overwritten
with the min_readlength pipeline parameter. For example:
#trim_galore min_readlength=0

The module will use the default
Illumina common adapter sequence to trim with, but this can be
overridden by specifying adapter=[Sequence] in the options.
