FastQ to Tophat Pipeline
------------------------
This pipeline takes FastQ files as input, runs FastQC, Trim Galore,
then aligns with tophat. It requires a genome reference with a
corresponding bowtie2 index base in the configuration. If a GTF file
is defined for the genome idex it will be used, otherwise Tophat will
align without gene model annotations. After alignment, Subread
featureCounts is used to count gene read overlaps.
